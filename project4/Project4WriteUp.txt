Project 4 write up
Charlie Grant
I have done it mostly. 
I had to add a new way to detect the value for EA because it was unreliably flagging the lines when using more than 1 word. 
I used regex and just made a large amount of instances to pull from. I am able to handle any kind of input but the kind that outputs some kind of text is still somewhat rigid. 
However, I did implement the match idea from class, however it does not take into account alternate words which is why I provide the list of items and the barrier is quite low. 
There are multiple comments in the code that display my testing as I was running into a lot of trouble specifically with EA. 
I might eventually change how the file is chosen because currently the user selects 1 or 2 and then asks questions, because the structure of my code would be so changed from implementing the detection of which company is being talked about in the question. 
That being said, I am content with how the code works. I also did not make the same mistake I made in my last project. 
I often code in the same project that I used for the last one and then rename it right before I turn it in. 
But I forgot to build the code last time meaning the debug was still for project 2 and did not match project 3. 
For some reason, right now in eclipse it says there are multiple errors in almost every class, but it runs great without issues. 
If you could explain why the code repeats at first when the company is chosen that would be great. 
Please be kind, I wanted an A in this class, don’t think it is possible anymore.
Also I don’t have many comments because I feel the titles of the classes and patterns kind of explain themselves in the name.
